# change_machine

A change machine built with Ruby and Rscript for Test-Driven Development (TDD). What you get is a change machine that returns the lowest possible number of coins. It was inspired by this challenge:

Create a method that will take a number of cents and return an array of coins that will be your change. The goal is to return as few coins as possible. Assume that the highest denomination of coins will be a quarter (25 cents). For example: If the method receives 119, the result will be [25, 25, 25, 25, 10, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1].
